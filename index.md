## About Me

My name is Ricardo Rei, and I am a Senior Research Scientist at Unbabel, where I focus on research in multilingual Large Language Models (LLM) and Machine Translation. Recently, I completed my PhD at Instituto Superior T√©cnico (IST), University of Lisbon, earning the distinction of Summa cum laude for my work on Machine Translation evaluation. This doctoral journey was part of a collaborative program between Unbabel, IST, and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), known as [Multilingual AI Agents Assistants (MAIA)](https://www.cmuportugal.org/large-scale-collaborative-research-projects/maia/).

During my PhD, I was under the guidance of Alon Lavie from CMU and Lu√≠sa Coheur from IST. While the primary focus of my thesis was Machine Translation Evaluation, my academic journey also involved exploring other areas within Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as decoding, uncertainty and efficient NLP.

Beyond academia, I have a passion for sports and I am an avid surfer üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Currently, I split my time between London and Lisbon.
