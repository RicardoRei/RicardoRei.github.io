## About Me

Welcome to my profile! I am currently in the final year of my PhD program, pursuing research in Machine Translation. My doctoral studies are part of a collaborative project known as [Multilingual AI Agents Assistants (MAIA)](https://www.cmuportugal.org/large-scale-collaborative-research-projects/maia/), which is a partnership between Unbabel, Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST), and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

Under the guidance and supervision of Alon Lavie, who is affiliated with both Unbabel and CMU, and Luisa Coheur from IST, I have been conducting cutting-edge research in the area of Machine Translation Evaluation. Throughout my academic journey, I have also explored other domains within NLP, including Automatic Transcription Enrichment and Dialog Systems.

One of the notable contributions I have made to the field of MT is the development of [COMET (Cross-lingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation)](https://github.com/Unbabel/COMET), an open-source framework dedicated to evaluating machine translation systems.

Beyond the realms of academia and research, I have a strong connection with the vibrant coastal city of Lisbon. In my leisure time, you can often find me surfing the waves that grace the shores of Lisbon.
