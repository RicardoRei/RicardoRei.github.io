## About Me

Welcome to my profile! I am currently in the final year of my PhD, doing research in Machine Translation. My PhD is part of a collaborative project known as [Multilingual AI Agents Assistants (MAIA)](https://www.cmuportugal.org/large-scale-collaborative-research-projects/maia/), which is a partnership between Unbabel, Instituto Superior T√©cnico (IST), and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

My supervisors are [Alon Lavie](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alavie/), from Unbabel and CMU, and [Lu√≠sa Coheur](https://www.hlt.inesc-id.pt/w/Lu%C3%ADsa_Coheur) from IST.

The main topic of my thesis has been Machine Translation Evaluation yet, throughout my academic journey, I have also worked on other NLP tasks such as Automatic Transcription Enrichment and Dialog Systems.

Beyond my academic life, I have a strong connection with the ocean and in my free time, you can often find me surfing üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
