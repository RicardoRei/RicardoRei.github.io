## About Me

I am currently in the final year of my PhD at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, specializing in the field of Machine Translation Evaluation. Concurrently, I hold the position of Research Scientist at Unbabel, where I have been actively engaged in cutting-edge research in various areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Throughout my academic journey, I have delved into topics such as Machine Translation, Automatic Transcription Enrichment, and Dialog Systems, expanding my expertise and contributing to advancements in these fields.

Beyond the realms of academia and research, I have a strong connection with the vibrant coastal city of Lisbon. In my leisure time, you can often find me surfing the waves that grace the shores of Lisbon. This lifelong hobby not only brings me joy but also serves as a reminder of the importance of balance and connecting with nature amidst the demands of intellectual pursuits.
